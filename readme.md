# Boston House Price  Prediction
The project "Boston House Prediction" is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of houses in Boston based on various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and pupil-teacher ratio by town. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
